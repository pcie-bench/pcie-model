    """
    This code estimates the PCIe bandwidth requirements for a device
    which looks very much like a Intel Niantic NIC.

    @param pcicfg    PCIe configuration
    @param bwspec    Bandwidth specification
    @param pkt_size  Size of the Ethernet frame (subtract 4 to calculate
                     with FCS stripping)
    @param irq_mod   Controls interrupts. IRQ every n packets. 0 no IRQ
    @param h_opt     Host driver optimisations (see below)
    @returns A BW_Res object

    The details below are taken from the Intel 82599 10 GbE Controller
    Datasheet, specifically, the following sections:

    - 1.9.1 Transmit (Tx) Data Flow
    - 7.2.1.2 Transmit Path in the 82599
    - 7.2.3.4 Transmit Descriptor Fetching
    - 7.2.3.2.4 Advanced Transmit Data Descriptor

    - 1.9.2 Receive (Rx) Data Flow
    - 7.1.6 Advanced Receive Descriptors
    - 7.1.7 Receive Descriptor Fetching

    Throughout we assume the advanced descriptor format being used.
    We further assume that a single RX and TX ring is being used.

    TX from the host:
    1. Host updates the TX queue tail pointer            (PCIe write: rx)
    2. Device DMAs descriptor(s)                         (PCIe read:  rx/tx)
    3. Device DMAs packet content                        (PCIe read:  rx/tx)
    4. Device writes back TX descriptor                  (PCIe write: tx)
    5. Device generates interrupt                        (PCIe write: tx)
    6. Host reads TX queue head pointer                  (PCIe read:  rx/tx)
    Note: The device may fetch up to 40 TX descriptors at a time
    Note: The device may prefetch TX descriptors if its internal Q
          becomes close to empty.  We don't model that.
    Note: TX descriptor write back (step 4) is optional and can be
          batched if TXDCTL[n].WTHRESH is set to non-0.  Default on
          Linux seems to be 8.
    Note: There is an optional head pointer write back which disables
          TX descriptor right back.  This is enable via
          TDWBAL[n].Head_WB_En and is disabled by default on Linux.
    Note: All descriptors are 128bit
    Note: The linux driver updates the TX tail pointer on every packet

    RX to the host:
    1. Host updates RX Queue Tail Pointer -> free buf    (PCIe write: rx)
    2. Device DMAs descriptor from host                  (PCIe read:  rx/tx)
    3. Device DMAs packet to host                        (PCIe write: tx)
    4. Device writes back RX descriptor                  (PCIe write: tx)
    5. Device generates interrupt                        (PCIe write: tx)
    6. Host reads RX queue head pointer                  (PCIe read:  rx/tx)
    Note: By default the Ethernet FCS is stripped before transmitting
          to the host. HLREG0.RXCRCSTRP.  We leave it up to the caller to
          determine if the FCS should be stripped.
    Note: Niantic does not pre-fetch freelist descriptors.  They are
          fetched on demand, when needed.
    Note: Niantic does not seem to be doing any batching of RX
          descriptor write-back unless descriptors belong to the same
          packet (e.g. RSC).
    Note: All descriptors are 128bit

    The default configuration is based on the Linux kernel ixgbe
    driver and how it sets up and uses the NIC.  The DPDK poll mode
    driver uses interacts with the device slightly different.
    Specifically:
    - TX: Steps 5 and 6 are omitted.  No interrupts are generated on
      transmit and the TX Descriptor Done is checked to free
      transmitted buffers.  TX descriptors are enqueue in batches of 32
    - RX: Steps 5 and 6 are omitted.  No interrupts are generated on
      receive and the RX Descriptor Done is checked to new packets.
